## stubble goose

G12.#

wending herds of mostly mammals -- ewes, and rams and bullocks -- herds of
the fourpin blossoms of animal husbandry -- among those ruminants come stubble geese.

Though we're off to slaughter  
A goose waddles proud  
Evincing goose hauteur  _
in fields new mowed.

-- Yer Ass, 2019

And many a gooses daughter alights at the comely trees 'n the lawn
