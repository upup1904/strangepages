## stubble goose

G12.103

Amidstt otherwise fourpin wending generation of animal husbandry --
ewes, and rams and bullocks -- amidst those ruminants strut stubble
geese.

'sdouble geese: It rhymes with "double"; from O.F. *estouble*, Skeat
who cites Chaucer *stoble-goose* C.T. 4351.

Though we're off to slaughter  
A goose waddles proud  
Evincing goose hauteur  _
in fields new mowed.  

-- Yer Ass, 2019

And many a goose's daughter alights at the comely trees 'n the lawn
